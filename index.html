<p> <b>Prerequisites</b>: Undergraduate algorithms (COMS 4231) or equivalent mathematical maturity.  The intended audience is first-year graduate students
  with a strong interest in and affinity for theoretical computer science.

  <!--
<p>

<b>Course description:</b>
Randomness pervades the natural processes around us, from the
formation of networks, to genetic recombination, to quantum
physics. Randomness is also a powerful tool that can be leveraged to
create algorithms and data structures which, in many cases, are more
efficient and simpler than their deterministic counterparts. This
course covers the key tools of probabilistic analysis, and
applications of these tools to understand the behaviors of random
processes and algorithms. Emphasis is on theoretical foundations,
though we will apply this theory broadly, discussing applications in
machine learning and data analysis, networking, and systems.

<!--
<li><b>Exercise Sets (0%)</b>: 
Exercise sets will be handed out weekly and are meant to help
you keep up with the course material.
Do not turn in your solutions.  Think about them and discuss with
fellow students or the course staff any that you cannot answer.
At least half of each exam will consist of 
problems on these exercise sets or variations thereof.

<li><b>Problem Sets (60%)</b>: 
  There will be a number of problem sets, around 8-9 in total.
  Problem sets can be completed in pairs.  Further details TBA.
<!--
  Here is the schedule:

<!--
<p>

<li><b>Problem Set Policies</b>: 
<ul>
<li>These are challenging and you are strongly encouraged to form
  groups, of up to three students.  Each group should turn in a single
  write-up (all students of the group receive the same score).
<li>You can form different groups for different problem sets.
<li>You can discuss problems with students from other groups
verbally and at a high level only.
<li>
Except where otherwise noted, you may refer to your course notes, the
  textbooks and research papers listed on the course Web
  page <b>only</b>. You cannot refer to textbooks, handouts, or
  research papers that are not listed on the course home page. If you
  do use any approved sources, make you sure you cite them
  appropriately, and make sure that all your words are your own.
<li>You are strongly encouraged to use LaTex to typeset your write-up.
Here's a <a href="template.tex">LaTeX template</a> that you can use to 
type up solutions.  <a
href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX">Here</a> 
and <a href="http://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf">here</a> are good
introductions to LaTeX.
<li><b>Honor code:</b> We expect you to abide by the computer science department's
  <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/honesty/">policies and procedures regarding academic honesty</a>.
<li><b>Submission instructions:</b> 
  We are using Gradescope for the homework submissions. Go to
  <a href="http://www.gradescope.com">www.gradescope.com</a> to either login or create a new
  account. Use the 
  course code 9D6V5E to register for this class. Only one group member
  needs to submit the assignment. When submitting, please remember to
  add all group member names onto Gradescope.

</ul>

-->

  <p>

<li><b>Late Days</b>: 
<ul>
<li>One late day equals a 24-hour extension.
<li>Each student has three free late days.
<li>At most two late days can be applied to a single assignment.
  <!--;
after Friday (following the original due date) no solutions
  will be accepted.
-->
<li>Each late day used after the first two will result in a 25%
  penalty.
<ul>
<li>Example: a student had one free late day remaining but his/her
  group uses two late days on a Problem Set.  If the group's write-up
  earns p points, the student receives a final score of .75*p points
  for the assignment.
</ul>

</ul>

<p>

  <li><b>Research project (40%)</b>: To be completed in teams of 3-4
students. The project can be theoretical or application-focused, and
should relate to the course content but otherwise can be on a topic of
your choosing. A single report of 15-20 pages will be due shortly
after the final lecture.
